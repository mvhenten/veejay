Veejay's GMIC plugin pack
-------------------------

veejay experiment using G'MIC (GREYC's Magic for Image Computing)

https://gmicol.greyc.fr/

----

NOTICE

Most of the GMIC filters are not realtime - For some you can expect frame-rates of 1-5 FPS or even lower at 1280x720

Nevertheless, they are all amazing effectors!


NOTICE

Livido is experimental too, as you can see there is only the use of the INDEX parameter


----

RUNNING:

run the autogen.sh scrypt in the suorce folder,
then run ./configure, make and make install

run veejay

-----




It is trivial to create your own FX , GMIC has a command style interface so the livido plugin only formats a command message and sends it off



livido_process_f                process_instance( livido_port_t *my_instance, double timecode ) {

 //livido stuff

        char cmd[256];
	//format a message, see http://gmic.eu/reference.shtml#subsection15 
        snprintf(cmd,sizeof(cmd),"-cartoon %d,%d,%d,%f,%f,%d",
                                        smoothness,sharpening,threshold,(float)thickness/100.0f, (float)color/100.0f, ... );

	// push an input frame
        lvdgmic_push( gmic, w, h, 0, A, 0);

	// send command
        lvdgmic_gmic( gmic, cmd );

	// pull result
        lvdgmic_pull( gmic, 0, O );
 
}


If you change the command of a plugin, keep in mind that you could also update the parameter description port to keep things parametrized
