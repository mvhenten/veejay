Bio(blocked i/o) 2 jack.

A library for enabling easy porting of blocked io(OSS/ALSA) applications to 
the jack sound server(http://jackit.sourceforge.net).  This library allows the 
person porting the code to simply replace the calls into OSS/ALSA with 
calls into interface functions of this library.  The library buffers a 
small amount of audio data and takes care of the rest of the jack 
implementation including the linked list of audio data buffers and the jack 
callback.  

Interface functions:
TODO: once these become stable copy and paste from the header file


Currently these drivers use the bio2jack library:
