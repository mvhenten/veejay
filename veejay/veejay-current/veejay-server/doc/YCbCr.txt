Veejay processing
=================

	Veejay processes nativly in YUV, this is to keep colorspace conversions
        to a minimum.

		YUV 4:2:0 Planar ( 1 Cr and 1 Cb sample per 2x2 Y samples)
		YUV 4:2:2 Planar ( 1 Cr and 1 Cr sample per 1x2 Y samples)  
		(both full range JPEG and clipped to 16-235 / 16-240)
	
	Places where veejay uses software conversion:
		Conversion from RGB to YUV is for webcam devices.
		Conversion from YUV to RGB is for preview image
		Some FX convert the frame to RGB

Why YUV ?
=========

	- Many video codecs decode into some YUV flavour
	- Many capture devices deliver YUV 
	- Software conversion of RGB <-> YUV was expensive
	- Consumes less memory bandwith then RGB
