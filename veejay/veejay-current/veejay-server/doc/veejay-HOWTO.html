<h2><a name="2.2">2.2</a> Hardware configuration</h2><p>

Veejay requires at least a linux kernel 2.4.x, 2.6.x or later, a lot of diskspace and a fast CPU.
Depending on the speed of your machine, your milage may vary. See the list below for
a few systems veejay was reported to work on:<br> 
<ul>
<li>An Intel Pentium 4 3.0 Ghz HT/512 MB DDR RAM with a ATI Radeon 9600 XT
<li>A dual celeron 400 Mhz/512 MB RAM with a voodoo3 and second pci card.  
<li>An Athlon 750 Mhz with voodoo3 and second pci card.
<li>An Athlon 750 Mhz with Matrox G400 Dualhead(TVout using X11/SDL or DirectFB)
<li>An Athlon 850 Mhz and Matrox G550 Dualhead( TVout support through DirectFB)
<li>An Athlon XP 1600 Mhz and Matrox G550 Dualhead( TVout support through DirectFB)
<li>A Pentium 4 2.2 Ghz and Matrox G550 Dualhead( TVout support through DirectFB)
<li>A Pentium 4 3.0 Ghz and ATI Radeon 9600 XT/ (no TVout yet)
<li>Sony Playstation 2 (MIPS, little endian) (but runs very slow +/- 20 fps)
</ul><br>
Video Editing requires a lot of diskspace, make sure you you have enough diskspace available for
your project. If you are going to use the recording functions, make sure you have sufficient free disk space available.Otherwise you are quite safe, veejay does not change your original video or fill your harddisk with needless temporary files. Neither does it waste your resources (unless you fill the effect chain with a lot of effects)<br> 
</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Installation</a></h2><p>
</p>

<h2><a name="3.1">3.1 Dependencies</a></h2><p>
Before you install Veejay, you should install the following software packages.
Although none of them is required, Veejay will be much less usable without them.<br>
<ul> 
<li>(required) mjpegtools >= 1.9.0
<li>(required) The XML C library 2 for gnome >= 2.5.4
<li>(required) libunicap >= 0.2.0
<li>(required) ffmpeg (libavcodec, etc) >= 0.50.0
<li>(optional) libdv >= 1.02 
<li>(optional) The SDL library >= 1.2.3
<li>(optional) JACK low latency audio server >= 0.98.1
<li>(optional) DirectFB >= 0.9.17
<li>(optional) FreeType >= 2.1.9 
<li>(optional) GTK >= 2.6.0
</ul>
<br>
<i>On newer distributions, some of the listed software is already installed but you may be missing the -devel- packages! (especially on redhat, suse and debdian systems!!)</i><br><br>
You can find the websites of these projects in <a href="veejay-HOWTO.html#6">Other Resources</a>.<br><br>
</p>
<h3><a name="3.1.0">3.1.0 From source</a></h3><p>
You can compile the following packages from source if your distribution does not include them:<br>
<ul>
<li>libavcodec, libavutil, libswscale and libavformat from the FFmpeg project
<li>mjpegtools
<li>unicap
<li>gtkcairo
</ul>
<br>
<h4>FFmpeg</h4>
<p>
You can download the ffmpeg sources from the SVN repository via <a href="http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net">http://ffmpeg.sourecforge.net"</a>
After downloading and unpacking the source tarball, run the configure script with the following options:<br>
<pre>
$ ./configure --enable-swscaler --enable-shared --enable-gpl
...
$ make
# make install
</pre>
</p>
</p>
<h4>MjpegTools, Unicap</h4>
You can download the MjpegTools from <a href="http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net">http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net</a><br>
and the Unicap Imaging library from <a href="http://unicap.sourceforge.net">http://unicap.sourceforge.net</a><br>
<br>
Compilation of both packages is straightforward , in general the following will do it:<br>
<pre>
$ ./configure && make
# make install
</pre>
</p>
<h4>GtkCairo</h4>
<p>
	GtkCairo is available from the veejay repository.
<pre>
</pre>
</p>
<h2><a name="3.2">3.2 Installing veejay</a></h2><p>
Verify that the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable is set to the directory containing files like jack.pc and directfb.pc to include them in the build process. If it is not set , the configure script will abort with an error message.
<pre>
$ echo $PKG_CONFIG_PATH   
</pre>
If nothing is set, do something like
<pre>
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
</pre>
Decompress and untar the file by typing:
<pre>
$ tar -jxvf veejay-1.1.x.tar.bz2
</pre>
Change to the directory containing veejay's source's:
<pre>
$ cd veejay-1.1.x

$ ./configure
</pre>
On completion it will summarize the results of the ./configure script, which could look like this:
<pre>
configure:  Veejay 1.1 build configuration :

configure:   - Jack Audio Connection Kit     : false
configure:   - XML c library for Gnome       : true
configure:   - Freetype support              : true
</pre>
Now, you can start building veejay
<pre>
$ make
</pre>
Followed by
<pre>
# make install
</pre>
</p>

<h2><a name="3.3">3.3 Setting up multicast</h2><p>

Multicast is a technology that reduces network traffic by
simultaneously delivering a single stream of information
to any interested recipient.
<br><br>
To enable multicast in Veejay, you must have enabled <i>IP multicast</i>
in your kernel configuration.
<br><br>
Finally you need to add a multicast route :
<pre>
for 1 ethernet device:
# route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0

for > 1 
# route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.100.1 dev eth1
</pre>
<br>
Next, Veejay can be started with the commandline flags
<b>-M/--multicast-osc</b> and/or <b>-V/--multicast-vims</b>
<br>

</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Using Veejay</a></h2><p>
Veejay uses by default a SDL window to play the video.
All the keybinding in veejay depend on SDL; if you move your mouse over to the
SDL windows to focus it , you can press the keys explained in <a href="veejay-HOWTO.html#4.3">4.3 The keyboard interface</a>.<br>
To use veejay in commandline style interface mode, see  
<a href="veejay-HOWTO.html#4.2">4.2 sayVIMS</a>.<br>
You must no longer provide a video file to use with veejay; it will run in dummy mode by
using the '-d' commandline parameter:<br>
<pre>
$ veejay -d
</pre>
<br>
To use the graphical client with veejay:
<pre>
$ reloaded -h localhost
</pre>
<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="4.1">4.1 Terminology and limitations</a></h2><p>
Veejay has a number of playback modes, each playback mode is unique and defines more or less
a different functionality:<br><br>
Also, note that veejay runs in only 1 resolution at a time (depending on the video dimensions of
the first loaded movie). All movies loaded must have identical properties, otherwise veejay will not start.
This limitation is also valid when streaming video from veejay to another veejay.<br>

<h2><a name="4.2">4.2 VIMS</a></h2><p>
<pre>

Use the command 
$ veejay -u -n |less

to dump all VIMS messages.

1.1 Message Format
==================

A message is described as:

	 <Action Identifer> : <Argument List> ; 

Example:

	080:;
	099:0 0;


<Action Identifier>
The action identifier is a 3 digit number describing a Network Event  
The colon is used to indicate the start of the Argument List and must be given. 


<Argument List>
The Argument List is described by a printf() style formatted template 
which describes the number and type of arguments to be used. 

The semicolon must be given to indicate the end of this message

1.2 Bundled Messages
====================

A message bundle is a special message that contains an ordered list of at least 1 or more messages. Each message is executed from left to right (first in, first out) while parsing the bundle.   


Example:

	5032|BUN:002{361:0 3 56 230 93 0;361:0 4 1 7;}|
	5033|BUN:003{361:0 3 56 230 93 0;361:0 4 1 7;361:0 5 1 7;}|
	5034|BUN:003{361:0 3 56 230 93 0;361:0 4 1 7;361:0 5 1 8;}|


A message bundle is described as:

	 BUN: <Number of Messages> { 
		<Action Idenfifier> : <Argument List> ;
		<Action Identifier> : <Argument List> ;
		... 
		}
		;


The token 'BUN:' indicates the start of a messaage bundle, the first 3 digit numeric value represents the total number of messages in the bundle. The '{' symbol indicates the start of a message block and is ended with '};' or just '}'. 


1.3 Format of an Action File/Attaching Keys to Bundles
======================================================

	<501 - 599> | <message bundle> |

The contents of some action file can be :

	516|BUN:001{355:;}|



The message bundle BUN sends '355' for clear effect chain.
This message bundle is attached to action identifier 516.

A key is attached to this function trough using the GUI (GVeejay)
or by using: 


DYNAMIC KEYMAPPING:
==================

	"083:516 <sdl symbol> <modifier> <optional arguments>;"


The message bundle can be attached to a key , for example 'SHIFT + A' by sending 
	
	083:516 97 3;

Which attaches bundle '516' to SDL key '97' using a modifier '3', which is SHIFT. 

Modifiers: 0 = none, 1 = alt , 2 = ctrl,  3 = shift
Keys     : see SDLkeysym.h somewhere in include/SDL/

If the number 0 is used for an event number, a given key combination can be
unset (wiped) :

	083:0 97 3;

Alternativly, you can bind keys to any action identifier. The complete
list can be viewd by typing veejay -u |less or with Gveejay. 

	083:20 97 0 4;

The example above sets key 'a' to 'change video speed to 4'



General  description of VIMS messages
=====================================  


Some reserved numbers:

	clip id		0	:	select currently playing clip	
	clip id		-1	:	select highest clip number 
        chain entry	-1      :   	select current chain entry 
	stream id 	0	:	select currently playing stream 
	stream id 	-1	:	select highest stream number
	key modifier	        :	0 = normal, 1= alt , 2 = ctrl, 3 = shift

<h2><a name="#4.2"></a>sayVIMS</h2>
<br><br>
sayVIMS is a commandline utility distributed with the veejay package,
it allows you to give short commands in interactive mode<br><br>
<i>$ sayVIMS -i -h localhost -p 3490</i><br><br>
Typing '?' followed by pressing ENTER gives the list of command below:
<pre>
  vi [file]           Open video4linux device 
  fi [file]           Open Y4M stream for input 
  fo [file]           Open Y4M stream for output 
  av [file]           Open (almost any) video file using FFmpeg 
  mc [address] [port] Open a multicast UDP video stream 
  pr [hostname][port] Open a unicast TCP video stream
  cl [file]           Load cliplist from file 
  cn [n1] [n2]        New clip from frames n1 to n2 
  cd [n]              Delete clip n1 
  sd [n]              Delete Stream n1 
  cs [file]           Save cliplist to file

  al [file]           Action file Load 
  as [file]           Action file save 
  de                  Toggle debug level (default off) 
  be                  Toggle bezerk mode (default on) 
</pre>
Also, you can send messages in VIMS format (or files, containing VIMS messages )<br><br>
For example, add the Pixelate effect on the Effect Chain of the current playing stream or clip:
<pre>
sayVIMS -h localhost -p 3490 "361:0 0 150 3;"
</pre>
<br>
Last but not least, sayVIMS can parse files containing VIMS messages.<br>
See the test/examples directory of the package for a list of perl
scripts that output a VIMS script.<br>
<pre>
sayVIMS -f advocate.vims -h localhost -p 3490
</pre>
<br>
Alternativly, you can start a secundary veejay and stream from peer to peer in uncompressed video:
<br>
<pre>
$ veejay -d -p 5000

$ sayVIMS -h localhost -p 5000 "245:localhost 3490;"

(press 'F7' in veejay to display the stream, prob. stream 7)
</pre>
Or for multicast:
<pre>
$ veejay -V 224.0.0.50 -p 5000 -n -L movie1.avi

$ veejay -d 

$ sayVIMS -h localhost -p 3490 "246:224.0.0.50 5000;"

$ veejay -d -p 4000

$ sayVIMS -h localhost -p 4000 "246:224.0.0.50 5000;"

</pre>

Or, if you want to play a XVID movie (or any other compressed format that is not I frame only):
<pre>
$ sayVIMS -h localhost -p 3490 "244:/tmp/my-XVID-movie.avi;"
</pre>

<h2><a name="4.3">4.3 The keyboard interface</a></h2><p>
Here is a quick overview for the most used default keys, if applied in order you will end up
with a newly created video sample looping in some way (depending on how many times you press the asterix key)<br>

<br><br>
The function keys <b>F1</b>...<b>F12</b> can be used to select sample <b>1</b> ... <b>12</b>,
use the keys <b>1</b>...<b>9</b> to select a sample range <b>1-12</b> ... <b>108-120</b> and press
one of the <b>F</b>-keys to play that sample.<br>
<br>
Use <b>ESC</b> to switch between samples and streams.
Press <b>ESC</b> again to switch back to the sample playmode<br>
You can create new input streams by using the console interface or by using GVeejay.<br>
All new input streams (and samples) are auto numbered.<br>
<br><br>
</p>

<h2><a name="4.4">4.4 Recording video</a></h2><p>
You can record video to a new clip , by using the stream- or clip recorder functions.<br>
For example, to record a new clip from a playing clip in MJPG format:<br>
<pre>
302:mjpg;
</pre>
Record 100 frames and start playing new clip when ready:
<pre>
130:100 1;
</pre>
Record the whole clip and dont start playing new clip when ready:
<pre>
130:0 0;
</pre>
If your Effect Chain is very CPU demanding , consider disabling audio and using the commandline parameter -c 0 to
disable sync correction.<br>
<br>
It is possible to start veejay headless and have it write all video data to
a (special) file for further processing.<br><br>
Refer to chapter <a href="veejay-HOWTO.html#5.3">5.3</a> for some examples.<br><br>

<h2><a name="4.5">4.5 Streaming video</a></h2><p>
You can create an input stream to read video coming from a video4linux device, from a pipe 
or from a network socket (both unicast and multicast).<br>
<h3><a name="4.5.1">4.5.1 video4linux</a></h3>
To open a video4linux device use gveejay or type the command:<br>
<br>
<pre>
$ sayVIMS 240:0 1;
</pre>
The selector '240' tells veejay to open a video4linux device, the first argument '0' indicates
the device number (i.e. /dev/video0) and the last argument '1' indicates the video in port
of your capture card (in this case composite).<br>
Veejay will create a new stream see <a href="#4.4">chapter 4.4</a> for activating the stream.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="4.5.2">4.5.2 pipe</a></h3>
Veejay supports reading video data from a pipe (FIFO) by means of an input stream.<br>
The only supported transport format is yuv4mpeg (yuv 4:2:0). When playing YUV 4:2:2
the video stream will be sampled to YUV 4:2:0 and vice versa<br>
You can create the input stream by typing the command
<pre>
$ sayVIMS 243:/tmp/stream.yuv;
</pre> 
<h3><a name="4.5.3">4.5.3 network</a></h3>
To get frames from another running veejay, use the command:
<br>
<pre>
$ sayVIMS 245:<hostname> <portnum>;
</pre>
For example, sayVIMS 245:localhost 5000;<br>
<br>
If you want to send the same video to multiple running veejays accross the network,
you can save bandwith by starting the veejay you wish to use as server with the -V option.
<br>
You can use the -V <multicast address> option to start an optional multicast frame sender.<br>
First, you need a multicast route in your routing table. See chapter <a href="#3.3">3.3</a> for
a short introduction 
or consult a howto that disuccess setting up multicast for your operating system.
<br>
<br>
   
<pre>
$ veejay -V 224.0.0.50 -p 5000
</pre>

Start another veejay, and use this command:
<br>
<pre>
$ sayVIMS "246:5000 224.0.0.50;" 
</pre>
To create a new input stream. Start more veejays and use sayVIMS with the -p option to give
it a port offset number. <br> 
</p>
<h2><a name="4.6">4.6 Other utilities</a></h2><p>

Currently there are 4 extra utilities <b>yuv2rawdv</b> , <b>rawdv2yuv</b> , <b>sayVIMS</b> and <b>any2yuv</b> included in the veejay package for encoding
a Y'C<sub>B</sub>C<sub>R</sub> 4:2:0 stream to raw DV and vice versa.
<br><br>

<b>yuv2rawdv</b> takes input from STDIN and outputs to STDOUT, we illustrate this with 
a few examples.<br>
<br>
When loading yuv2raw dv without parameters you will see:<br>
<pre>
This program reads a YUV4MPEG stream and puts RAW DV to stdout
Usage:  yuv2rawdv [params]
where possible params are:
    -v num    Verbosity [0..2] (default 1)
    -l num    Clamp Luma (default 0)
    -c num    Clamp Chroma (default 0)
</pre>

If you use the clamp parameters, it will clip (not scale!) a pixel into a valid range,
the resulting video could be for example a bit darker if the input stream has values for
Luminance exceeding the maximum of 235.<br>
See the table below for all valid ranges.
<table border=0 width=80%>
<caption><h4>Y'C<sub>B</sub>C<sub>R</sub></h4></caption> 

<tr>
<td><i>Channel</i></td>
<td><i>Range (Clamp)</i></td>
<td><i>Byte range (no clamping)</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Y (Luminance)</td>
<td>16 - 235</td>
<td>0 - 255</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cb (Chroma Blue)</td>
<td>16 - 240</td>
<td>0 - 255</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cr (Chroma Red) </td>
<td>16 - 240</td>
<td>0 - 255</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>

To convert a yuv4mpeg file to rawdv (the yuv4mpeg file needs to be compatible with the
digital video format properties)<br>
<pre>$ cat yuv4mpeg-file.yuv | yuv2rawdv | playdv</pre>
<br><br>
To convert a yuv4mpeg file to rawdv with luminance and chroma information clipped
to a valid range:<br>
<pre>$ cat yuv4mpeg-file.yuv | yuv2rawdv -l 1 -c 1 | playdv</pre>
<br>

<br><br>
<b>rawdv2yuv</b> takes input from STDIN and outputs to STDOUT, we illustrate this with 
a few examples.<br>

<pre>
This program reads a raw DV stream from stdin and puts YV12/I420 to stdout
Usage:  rawdv2yuv [params]
where possible params are:
   -v num     Verbosity [0..2] (default 1)
   -x         Swap Cb/Cr channels to produce IV12 (default is I420)
   -n num     Norm to use: 0 = NTSC, 1 = PAL (default 1)
   -q         DV quality to fastest (Monochrome)
   -h         Output Half frame size
   -c num     clip off <num> rows of frame (for use with -h)
              must be a multiple of 8
</pre>
<br>
If you want to convert a full PAL/NTSC dv frame to half PAL YCbCr (I420 or YV12) you can
give the command:
<br>
<pre>
$ cat raw.dv | rawdv2yuv -h | yuvplay</pre>
<br>
You can use the -c parameter to clip the width of the video frame.<br>
<pre>
$ cat raw.dv | rawdv2yuv -h -c 8 | yuvplay</pre>
<br>
The resizer in rawdv2yuv uses a best neighbour interpolation algorithm for downsizing.<br>

<br><br>
<b>any2yuv</b> takes input from STDIN and puts YV12/I420 to stdout: 
<pre>
This program reads anything from stdin and puts YV12/I420 to stdout
Usage:  any2yuv [params]
where possible params are:
   -v num     Verbosity [0..2] (default 1)
   -x         Swap Cb/Cr channels to produce IV12 (default is I420)
   -n num     Norm to use: 0 = NTSC, 1 = PAL (default 1)
</pre>
<br>
<br><br>
<b>sayVIMS</b> can be used to send commands or files to batch-process to veejay
<pre>
Usage: sayVIMS [options] [messages]
where options are:
 -p             Veejay port (3490)
 -h             Veejay host (localhost)
 -g			    Veejay multicast address (224.0.0.50)
 -f <filename>  Send contents of this file to veejay
 -c             Colored output (geek feature)

Messages to send to veejay must be wrapped in quotes
You can send multiple messages by seperating them with a whitespace

<p>GNU Free Documentation License

<p>Version 1.1, March 2000

<p>Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
  59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

<p>0. PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

<p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

<p>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

<p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

<p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

<p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

<p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

<p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

<p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

<p>2. VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

<p>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

<p>4. MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

<p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission. 
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five). 
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher. 
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. 
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices. 
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. 
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. 
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. 
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence. 
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section. 
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. 
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein. 
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. 
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version. 
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

<p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

<p>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."

<p>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

<p>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. 
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

<p>8. TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

<p>9. TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<p>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

<p>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<br><pre>    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".
</pre>

<p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
