explain: 
	create sample 1
	create sample 2
	play sample 1
	play sample 1 in reverse
	wait 25 frames
	pause sample 1
	wait 25 frames
	start change direction and speed a few times
	end with speed 1
	wait 25 frames
	normal overlay with sample 2
	play sample 2 in reverse
	wait 25 frames
	play sample 2 in normal speed
	wait 25 frames
	start change direction and speed
	end with speed 0

expect after run:
	sample 1 is paused and sample 2 shines through and plays in speed 2 forward
